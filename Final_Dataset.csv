Big name bad service., Attitude problem right from reception/accounts person whoever he is.Burnt food given twice nobdy cares.Take bills shamelessly not even asking why food left as it is without being eaten., If there could be an option of zero stars, I would definitely put it.

Sardarji's Chaats & More,Negative,Ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat. Everything was very poor in taste. Better to put some effort and visit Bikanerwala in jubilee hills. Maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones.,80,20,3

Shah Ghouse Hotel & Restaurant,Negative,To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM . Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast .
